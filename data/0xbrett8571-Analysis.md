## Introduction

Livepeer is a decentralized video streaming protocol that uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to incentivize transcoders to provide video streaming services. The Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade introduces a new on-chain treasury that will be funded by a percentage of the protocol rewards. The treasury will be used to support the development and maintenance of the Livepeer protocol, as well as to fund community initiatives.

## Scope

The Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade includes the following changes:

* The creation of a new contract called `Treasury`.
* The modification of the `BondingManager` contract to support treasury rewards.
* The creation of a new contract called `GovernorCountingOverridable` that implements a voting counting module with support for delegators to override their delegates' votes.
* The modification of the `LivepeerGovernor` contract to use the `GovernorCountingOverridable` contract.

## Analysis

The Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade introduces a number of new risks and vulnerabilities that need to be considered. These include:

* The treasury could be used to fund malicious activities.
* The treasury could be drained by an attacker.
* The treasury could be used to centralize control of the Livepeer protocol.

To mitigate these risks, the following measures should be taken:

* The treasury should be carefully managed by a trusted set of actors.
* The treasury should be audited regularly to ensure that it is being used for its intended purpose.
* The treasury should be protected from attack by using secure coding practices and by implementing appropriate security measures.

## Recommendations

The following recommendations are made for the Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade:

* The treasury should be managed by a multi-sig wallet controlled by a trusted set of actors.
* The treasury should be audited regularly by a reputable security firm.
* The treasury should be protected from attack by using secure coding practices and by implementing appropriate security measures.
* The treasury should be used to fund activities that are aligned with the interests of the Livepeer community.

## Conclusion

The Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade is a significant development for the Livepeer protocol. It introduces a number of new risks and vulnerabilities, but it also has the potential to make the protocol more sustainable and resilient. The recommendations outlined in this report should be implemented to mitigate the risks and ensure that the treasury is used for its intended purpose.

## Additional Comments

The Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade is a complex piece of code and it is important to carefully consider all of the risks and implications before implementing it. The recommendations outlined in this report are intended to help the Livepeer community make an informed decision about whether or not to implement the upgrade.

Analysis of how Livepeer works:

Livepeer is a decentralized video streaming protocol that uses a peer-to-peer network of computers to transcode and distribute video. This makes it more scalable and cost-effective than traditional centralized video streaming solutions.

The Livepeer network is made up of two main types of participants: orchestrators and delegators.

* **Orchestrators** are computers that contribute their resources (CPU, GPU, and bandwidth) to transcoding and distributing video. They are rewarded for their work with LPT tokens.
* **Delegators** are token holders who stake their tokens to orchestrators. They do not need to have any technical expertise, but they still earn a share of the rewards that the orchestrators earn.

When a broadcaster wants to stream video, they pay fees to the Livepeer network. These fees are then distributed to the orchestrators and delegators in proportion to their contribution to the network.

The Livepeer protocol is designed to be secure, reliable, and efficient. It is also censorship-resistant, meaning that broadcasters cannot be censored by the network.

Here are some of the key benefits of using Livepeer:

* Scalability: Livepeer is a peer-to-peer network, which means that it can scale to meet the needs of any application.
* Cost-effectiveness: Livepeer is much more cost-effective than traditional centralized video streaming solutions.
* Reliability: Livepeer is designed to be highly reliable, with built-in redundancy to ensure that video streams are not interrupted.
* Efficiency: Livepeer uses a variety of techniques to ensure that video streams are delivered as efficiently as possible.
* Censorship resistance: Livepeer is censorship-resistant, meaning that broadcasters cannot be censored by the network.

Livepeer is still a relatively new protocol, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way that video is streamed. It is already being used by a number of major broadcasters, and it is likely to become even more popular in the future.

Here are some of the challenges that Livepeer faces:

* Security: Like any decentralized system, Livepeer is vulnerable to security attacks. However, the protocol is designed to be secure, and the team is constantly working to improve its security.
* Adoption: Livepeer is still a relatively new protocol, and it needs to gain more adoption in order to be successful. However, the team is working hard to promote the protocol, and it is likely to gain more adoption in the future.
* Competition: There are a number of other decentralized video streaming protocols, such as DLive and Theta Network. Livepeer needs to compete with these protocols in order to be successful.

Overall, Livepeer is a promising new protocol that has the potential to revolutionize the way that video is streamed. It is still a relatively new protocol, but it has a strong team and a clear vision. It is likely to become even more popular in the future.
