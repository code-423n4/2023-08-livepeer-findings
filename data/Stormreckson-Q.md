Failure to Check `transferFrom`Return Value in `bondWithHint` function

when using the `transferFrom` function  the code does not check the return value, which leaves the system vulnerable to potential errors or issues during the token transfer process.

 It is good practice to check the return value when using the `transferFrom` function in order to handle any potential errors or issues that may arise during the token transfer process. By checking the return value, you can ensure that the transfer was successful and take appropriate actions if any problems occur.


`livepeerToken().transferFrom(msg.sender, address(minter()), _amount);
        }`
          
No return value check and error handling

FIX:
Checking the return value of the transfer is recommended here's and example

```
require(livepeerToken().transferFrom(msg.sender, address(minter()), _amount), "Transfer failed");
```

In this code snippet, we use the require statement to check the return value of the transferFrom` function. If the transfer fails, the code will revert the transaction and display an error message.

Missing return value check in `Withdraw stake()`

there is no return value check after calling the `minter().trustedTransferTokens()` function. It is important to check the return value of this function to ensure the successful transfer of the tokens.

It is important to verify the return values of external contract calls to check if the operations were successful. This helps prevent unexpected behavior, handle error cases, and prevent potential exploits or vulnerabilities in the contract.

`minter().trustedTransferTokens(msg.sender, amount);`


There are also other instances of this same issue in the `BondingManager.sol` contract

In the `withdrawFees` ()

`minter().trustedWithdrawETH(_recipient, _amount);`

In `slashTranscoder()`

In `bondForWithHint()`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L616-L617

`livpeerToken().transferFrom(msg.sender, address(minter()), _amount)`



## Fix
you can add a return value check after the transfer operation by capturing the returned boolean value and validating it. Here is an example of how you can modify the code:

```
// Tell Minter to transfer stake (LPT) to the delegator
bool transferSuccess = minter().trustedTransferTokens(msg.sender, amount);
require(transferSuccess, "token transfer failed");
```

By checking the return value and adding the necessary validation, you can ensure that the token transfer operation is successful and handle any potential failure scenarios gracefully.
