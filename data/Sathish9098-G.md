# GAS OPTIMIZATION

##

## [G-1] Using ``memory`` can be more ``gas-efficient`` when calling the same variable for the second time compared to using ``storage``.

[As per gas test](https://gist.github.com/sathishpic22/7105cfc254ce026bf5f90c7ec272f0ce) this will save around 150 - 200 GAS . 

### ``lock.withdrawRound`` called second time so ``memory`` is more gas efficient than ``storage``

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L251 

```diff
FILE: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol

- 251: UnbondingLock storage lock = del.unbondingLocks[_unbondingLockId];
+ 251: UnbondingLock memory lock = del.unbondingLocks[_unbondingLockId];

```
##

## [G-2] Structs can be packed into fewer storage slots

Each slot saved can avoid an extra Gsset (20000 gas) for the first setting of the struct.

### ``lastClaimRound`` can be ``uint96`` instead of ``uint256`` . Saves ``2000 GAS`` , ``1 SLOT``

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L58-L68

``uint96`` is a data type representing an unsigned integer with 96 bits, which can store values ranging from 0 to ``2^96 - 1``. While this is a relatively large range of values, whether it's ``more than enough`` to store timestamps and durations.


```diff
FILE: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol

58: // Represents a delegator's current state
59:    struct Delegator {
60:        uint256 bondedAmount; // The amount of bonded tokens
61:        uint256 fees; // The amount of fees collected
62:        address delegateAddress; // The address delegated to
+ 65:        uint96 lastClaimRound; // The last round during which the delegator claimed its earnings
63:        uint256 delegatedAmount; // The amount of tokens delegated to the delegator
64:        uint256 startRound; // The round the delegator transitions to bonded phase and is delegated to someone
- 65:        uint256 lastClaimRound; // The last round during which the delegator claimed its earnings
66:        uint256 nextUnbondingLockId; // ID for the next unbonding lock created
67:        mapping(uint256 => UnbondingLock) unbondingLocks; // Mapping of unbonding lock ID => unbonding lock

## [G-3] ``IFâ€™s/require()`` statements that check ``input arguments`` should be at the top of the function

FAIL CHEEPLY INSTEAD OF COSTLY 

Checks that involve constants should come before checks that involve state variables, function calls, and calculations. By doing these checks first, the function is able to revert before wasting a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) in a function that may ultimately revert in the unhappy case.

### Cheaper to check the ``function parameter`` before creating ``storage variables ``
