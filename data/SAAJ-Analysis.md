# Comments for Judge
My findings are mainly related to improving the gas cost and quality code which is necessary for any codebase to be used efficiently by its user while having minimum gas cost.
QA and Gas reports are based on improving the working flow of the codebase that will help the protocol in avoiding mishaps that may cause limitation to protocol in providing services to the users effectively and efficiently.

# Approach
The approach i, take for reviewing the codebase is first going through the 10 minutes primer presentation that describe role for every one either its delegator or participators.
This help me in looking at different function that will be called various time by needs to improve in terms of gas efficiency as the protocol will be used by various individual multiple times. 

# Architecture Recommendations
The protocol should consider using its own token for participant rather than rewards in eth or stablecoins. Rewarding participants with tokens other than protocol own token will degrade its own value and little growth for the protocol.
