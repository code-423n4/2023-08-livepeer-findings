# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between August 31â€”September 6 2023.

This audit was judged by [hickuphh3](https://code4rena.com/@hickuphh3).

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 5 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 3 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 7 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 13 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer), and is composed of 3 interfaces and 7 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2,602 lines of Solidity code.

In addition to the known issues identified by the project team, a Code4rena bot race was conducted at the start of the audit. The winning bot, **henry** from warden hihen, generated the [Automated Findings report](https://gist.github.com/code423n4/7ad0b8f1cbfb9c35cebefdaedcf04d3c) and all findings therein were classified as out of scope.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] Underflow in `updateTranscoderWithFees` can cause corrupted data and loss of winning tickets](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/165)
*Submitted by [bronze\_pickaxe](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/165), also found by [VAD37](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/234), [ether\_sky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/184), and [Krace](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/75)*

`updateTranscoderWtihFees` can underflow because MathUtils is used instead of PreciseMathUtils.

### Proof of Concept

According to [LIP-92](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-92.md) the initial `treasuryRewardCutRate` will be set to `10%`.

`treasuryRewardCutRate` is set with the `setTreasuryRewardCutRate()`function, which calls the internal function `_setTreasuryRewardCutRate()`.

```javascript
file: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol

function _setTreasuryRewardCutRate(uint256 _cutRate) internal {
        require(PreciseMathUtils.validPerc(_cutRate), "_cutRate is invalid precise percentage");
```

In this function the value will be checked if it's a valid `PreciseMathUtils` percentage (<`100%` specified with 27-digits precision):

```javascript
file: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/libraries/PreciseMathUtils.sol
library PreciseMathUtils {
// ...
    // Divisor used for representing percentages
    uint256 public constant PERC_DIVISOR = 10**27;
	function validPerc(uint256 _amount) internal pure returns (bool) {
        return _amount <= PERC_DIVISOR;
    }
// ...
```

However, in `updateTranscoderWithFees`, to calculate `treasuryRewards`, `MathUtils` is used instead of `PreciseMathUtils`.

```javascript
file: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol

function updateTranscoderWithFees(
        address _transcoder,
        uint256 _fees,
        uint256 _round
    ) external whenSystemNotPaused onlyTicketBroker {
// ...
uint256 treasuryRewards = MathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);
rewards = rewards.sub(treasuryRewards);
// ...
}
```

`MathUtils` uses a `PREC_DIVISOR` of `1000000` instead of `10 ** 27` from the `PreciseMathUtils`:

```javascript
file: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/libraries/MathUtils.sol
library MathUtils {
// ...
    uint256 public constant PERC_DIVISOR = 1000000;
// ...
```

This leads to `treasuryRewards` value being bigger than expected. Here is a [gist of the POC](https://gist.github.com/bronzepickaxe/60063c47c327a1f2d4ee3dbd6361049b). Running the POC it shows that the current usage of `MathUtils` when calculating `treasuryRewards` will always cause an underflow in the next line of code.

`updateTranscoderWithFees` is called every time a winning ticket is redeemed. Whenever the transcoder has skipped the previous round reward call, this function has to re-calculate the rewards, as documented in [LIP-92](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-92.md?plain=1#L130). This re-calculation will always fail due to the underflow shown above.

### Impact

This will lead to accounting errors, unexpected behaviours and can cause a loss of winning tickets.

Firstly, the accounting errors and unexpected behaviours: these are all the storage values getting updated in `updateTranscoderWithFees`:

```javascript
file: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol

function updateTranscoderWithFees( address _transcoder,
        uint256 _fees,
        uint256 _round
    ) external whenSystemNotPaused onlyTicketBroker {
// ...
// transcoder & earningsPool.data
L314: Transcoder storage t = transcoders[_transcoder];
L321: EarningsPool.Data storage earningsPool = t.earningsPoolPerRound[currentRound];

//accounting updates happen here
L377: t.cumulativeFees = t.cumulativeFees.add(transcoderRewardStakeFees)
	  .add(transcoderCommissionFees);
L382: earningsPool.updateCumulativeFeeFactor(prevEarningsPool,delegatorsFees);
L384: t.lastFeeRound = currentRound;
```

*   Let `currentRound() - 1` be the previous round where the transcoder skipped the reward call
*   Let `currentRound()` be current round
*   Let `currentRound() + 1` be the next round

During `currentRound()` it won't be possible to update the `Transcoder` storage or `earningsPool.data` storage because of the underflow that will happen because `currentRound() - 1` reward call has been skipped by the transcoder.

During `currentRound() + 1` it will be possible to call `updateTranscoderWithFees`, however, L382 will only update the `prevEarningsPool`, which in this case will be `currentRound()`, not `currentRound - 1`. Therefor, the `EarningsPool.data.cumulativeRewardFactor` won't be updated for `currentRound() - 1`.

Lastly, the validity of a ticket is two rounds as per the [specs](https://github.com/livepeer/wiki/blob/master/spec/streamflow/pm.md?plain=1#L107). This means that a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` should be able to redeem it in `currentRound() - 1` and `currentRound()`. However, a transcoder that receives a winning ticket in `currentRound() - 1` wont be able to redeem it in `currentRound()` because of the underflow that happens while redeeming a winning ticket in `currentRound()`. The transcoder wont be able to redeem it after `currentRound + 1..N` because the ticket will be expired.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use `PreciseMathLib` instead of `MathLib`:

```javascript
file: 2023-08-livepeer/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol

L355: 
- uint256 treasuryRewards = MathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);
+ uint256 treasuryRewards = PreciseMathUtils.percOf(rewards, treasuryRewardCutRate);
```

## [[H-02] By delegating to a non-transcoder, a delegator can reduce the tally of someone else's vote choice without first granting them any voting power](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/96)
*Submitted by [Banditx0x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/96)*

A delegate can subtract their own voting weight from the voting choice of another delegate, even if that user isn't a transcoder. Since they are not a transcoder, they don't have their votes initially increased by the amount delegated to them, voting weight is still subtracted from the tally of their vote choice.

Maliciously, this could be used to effectively double one's voting power, by delegating their votes to a delegator who is about to vote for the choice which they don't want. It can also occur accidentally, for example when somebody delegates to a transcoder who later switches role to delegate.

### Proof of Concept

When a user is not a transcoder, their votes are determined by the amount they have delegated to the delegatedAddress, and does not increase when a user delegates to them:

```solidity
        if (bond.bondedAmount == 0) {
            amount = 0;
        } else if (isTranscoder) {
            amount = bond.delegatedAmount;
        } else {
            amount = delegatorCumulativeStakeAt(bond, _round);
        }
    }
```

Let's say that this delegator (Alice) has 100 votes and votes `For`, then another delegator(Bob) has delegated 1000 votes to Alice. As stated above, Alice doesn't get the voting power of Bob's 1000 votes, so the `For` count increases by 100.

Bob now votes, and `_handleVotesOverrides` is called. In this function, the first conditional, `if isTranscoder` will return false as Bob is not self-delegating.

Then, there is a check that the address Bob has delegated to has voted. Note that there is a missing check of whether the delegate address is a transcoder. Therefore the logic inside `if (delegateVoter.hasVoted)` is executed:

```solidity
if (delegateVoter.hasVoted) {
// this is a delegator overriding its delegated transcoder vote,
// we need to update the current totals to move the weight of
// the delegator vote to the right outcome.
VoteType delegateSupport = delegateVoter.support;

            if (delegateSupport == VoteType.Against) {
                _tally.againstVotes -= _weight;
            } else if (delegateSupport == VoteType.For) {
                _tally.forVotes -= _weight;
            } else {
                assert(delegateSupport == VoteType.Abstain);
                _tally.abstainVotes -= _weight;
            }
        }

```

The logic reduces the tally of whatever choice Alice voted for by Bob's weight. Alice initially voted `For` with 100 votes, and then the For votes is reduced by Bob's `1000 votes`. Lets say that Bob votes `Against`. This will result in an aggregate 900 vote reduction in the `For` tally and +1000 votes for `Agaisnt` after Alice and Bob has finished voting.

If Alice was a transcoder, Bob will be simply reversing the votes they had delegated to Alice. However since Alice was a delegate, they never gained the voting power that was delegated to her.

Bob has effectively gained the ability to vote against somebody else's votes (without first actually increasing their voting power since they are not a transcoder) and can vote themselves, which allows them to manipulate governance.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There should be a check that a delegate is a transcoder before subtracting the tally. Here is some pseudocode:

    if (delegateVoter.hasVoted && ---delegate is transcoder ---)

This is an edit of the conditional of the function `_handleOverrides`. This ensures that the subtraction of vote tally is only performed when the delegate is a voter AND the delegate is a transcoder. This should fix the accounting/subtraction issue of vote tally for non-transcoder delegates.

# Medium Risk Findings (3)
## [[M-01] The logic in `_handleVoteOverride` to determine if an account is the transcoder is not consistent with the logic in the `BondManager.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/206)
*Submitted by [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/206)*

In the current implementation, when voting, the function [\_countVote is triggered](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/treasury/GovernorCountingOverridable.sol#L151), this function is overridden in the function GovernorCountingOverridable.sol

```solidity
    _weight = _handleVoteOverrides(_proposalId, tally, voter, _account, _weight);
```

This is calling:

```solidity
   function _handleVoteOverrides(
        uint256 _proposalId,
        ProposalTally storage _tally,
        ProposalVoterState storage _voter,
        address _account,
        uint256 _weight
    ) internal returns (uint256) {

        uint256 timepoint = proposalSnapshot(_proposalId);

        address delegate = votes().delegatedAt(_account, timepoint);

        // @audit
        // is transcoder?
        bool isTranscoder = _account == delegate;
    
        if (isTranscoder) {
            // deduce weight from any previous delegators for this transcoder to
            // make a vote
            return _weight - _voter.deductions;
        }
```

The logic to determine if an account is the transcoder is too simple in this [line of code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/treasury/GovernorCountingOverridable.sol#L184):

```solidity
// @audit
// is transcoder?
bool isTranscoder = _account == delegate;
```

And does not match the logic that determine if the address is an registered transcorder and an active transcoder in the bondManager.sol.

In BondManager.sol, the function that used to check if a transcoder is registered is in this [line of code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L1156):

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Return whether a transcoder is registered
     * @param _transcoder Transcoder address
     * @return true if transcoder is self-bonded
     */
    function isRegisteredTranscoder(address _transcoder) public view returns (bool) {
        Delegator storage d = delegators[_transcoder];
        return d.delegateAddress == _transcoder && d.bondedAmount > 0;
    }
```

The function that is used to check if a transcoder is active is in [this line of code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L1145).

```solidity
    function isActiveTranscoder(address _transcoder) public view returns (bool) {
        Transcoder storage t = transcoders[_transcoder];
        uint256 currentRound = roundsManager().currentRound();
        return t.activationRound <= currentRound && currentRound < t.deactivationRound;
    }
```

Missing the check in the delegator's bond amount (delegators\[\_transcoder].bondeAmount > 0).

The code incorrectedly counts regular delegator as transcoder and does not update the deduction power correctly.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Reuse the function isRegisteredTranscoder and isActiveTranscoder to determine if an account is a registered and active transcoder when counting the voting power.

This report didn't manage to go specifically into that issue, but still pointed a valid problem which is in a sense the root cause there. FTR There is no problem with `isActiveTranscoder` though, since we don't give voting power only to active transcoders. That part of this report is invalid.

## [[M-02] Fully slashed transcoder can vote with 0 weight messing up the voting calculations](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/194)
*Submitted by Vagner ([1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/194), [2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/187)), also found by [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/224)*

If a transcoder gets slashed fully he can still vote with 0 amount of `weight` making any other delegated user that wants to change his vote to subtract their `weight` amount from other delegators/transcoders.

### Proof of Concept

In `BondingManager.sol` any transcoder can gets slashed by a specific percentage, and that specific transcoder gets resigned and that specific percentage gets deducted from his `bondedAmount`.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L394-L411>

If any `bondedAmount` will remain then the penalty will also gets subtracted from the `delegatedAmount`, if not, nothing happens.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L412-L417>

After that the `penalty` gets burned and the fees gets paid to the finder, if that is the case.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L420-L440>

The problem relies in the fact that a fully slashed transcoder, even if it gets resigned, he is still seen as an active transcoder in the case of voting. Let's assume this case:

*   A transcoder gets fully slashed and gets resigned from the transcoder pools, getting his `bondedAmount` to 0, but he still has `delegatedAmount` to his address since nothing happens this variable.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L402-L418>

*   Transcoder vote a proposal and when his weighting gets calculated [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/f34a3a7e5a1d698d87d517fda698d48286310bee/contracts/governance/GovernorUpgradeable.sol#L581), it will use the `_getVotes` from `GovernorVotesUpgradeable.sol`.<br>
<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/f34a3a7e5a1d698d87d517fda698d48286310bee/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorVotesUpgradeable.sol#L55-L61>

*   `_getVotes` calls `getPastVotes` on `BondingVotes.sol` <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingVotes.sol#L167-L170> which returns the amount of weight specific to this transcoder and as you can see, because the transcoder has a `bondedAmount` equal to 0, the first if statement will be true and 0 will be returned.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingVotes.sol#L372-L373>

*   0 weight will be passed into `_countVote` which will then be passed into `_handleVoteOverrides`.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/treasury/GovernorCountingOverridable.sol#L151>

*   Then it will check if the caller is a transcoder, which will be true in our case, because nowhere in the `slashTranscoder` function, or any other function the transcoder `delegateAddress` gets changed, so this if statement will be true <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/treasury/GovernorCountingOverridable.sol#L182-L184>, which will try to deduct the weight from any previous delegators.<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/treasury/GovernorCountingOverridable.sol#L184-L189>

*   If any delegator already overridden any amount this subtraction would revert, but if that is not the case, 0 weight will be returned, which is then used to vote `for`, `against` , `abstain`, but since 0 weight is passed no changed will be made.

*   Now the big problem arise, if any delegator that delegated their votes to this specific transcoder want to change their vote, when his weight gets calculated, `delegatorCumulativeStakeAt` gets called <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingVotes.sol#L459-L487> which will return most of the time his `bondedAmount`, amount which is greater than 0, since he didn't unbound.

*   Because of that when `_handleVoteOverrides` gets called in `_countVote`, to override the vote, this if statement will be true, since the transcoder voted already, but with 0 weight <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/treasury/GovernorCountingOverridable.sol#L195> and the delegator weight gets subtracted from the support that the transcoder used in his vote.

*   The system in this case expects the transcoder to vote with the whole `delegatedAmount`, which will make the subtraction viable, since the weight of the delegator should be included in the full `delegatedAmount` of that specific transcoder, but since the transcoder voted with 0 weight, the subtraction would be done from other delegators/transcoders votes.

*   Also this can be abused by a transcoder by voting a category which he knows will not get a lot of votes, if let's say a transcoder used his 0 weight to vote for `abstain` and every other voter will vote on `for` or `against`, every time one of his delegators want to change the vote the subtraction can revert, which will force those delegators out of the vote, until they will change their transcoder.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If a transcoder gets fully slashed and resigned, delete his address from `delegateAddress` so he will not appear as a transcoder in the mechanism of counting the votes. If he still wants to participate in the system he can act as a delegator to another transcoder. Another solution would be to not let 0 weight votes happen, since they don't modify the vote state at all.

 > Slashing is turned off in the protocol, so this specific issue is not that important. It did point towards an issue in `BondingVotes` though in the way that the `getBondingState` function checks if transcoder is a transcoder or not and defaults to 0 when `bondedAmount` is `0`. There are other ways that this logic can be triggered (not through `slashTranscoder`) that can show inconsistencies as well, so I'm flagging this as valid for the underlying issue that it hints to, even though it does not describe a realistic scenario about how this issue could happen.

 > I found the POC hard to follow. A coded instance would have tremendously helped, but what I gather is:
> - fully slashed transcoder that votes will do so with 0 weight.
> - any delegator that delegated their votes to this specific transcoder intending to change their vote may face an issue with sub overflow because `_handleVoteOverrides()` uses the slashed transcoder's `bondedAmount` instead of the 0 weight.

Some will only pop into mind through discussions with wardens, which seemed to be the case here when the slashing deprecation was mentioned a couple of times in the Discord channel.

> On the flip side, the fact remains that the slashing mechanism is part of the audit scope, and was counted towards the sLOC, plus the points I raised above. There wasn't an indication in the code that slashing had been deprecated.

> It's a difficult decision here, considering the different parties' POV. There could be some wardens who didn't submit issues related to slashing because of what was brought up in the Discord channel, and those that did (as one can see referenced above) because they didn't monitor the channel.

## [[M-03] `withdrawFees` does not update checkpoint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/104)
*Submitted by [ADM](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/104), also found by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/257), [twicek](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/92), and [HChang26](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/27)*

BondingVotes may have stale data due to missing checkpoint in `BondingManager#withdrawFees()`.

### Proof of Concept

The withdrawFee function has the autoClaimEarnings modifier:

```Solidity
    function withdrawFees(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount) external whenSystemNotPaused currentRoundInitialized autoClaimEarnings(msg.sender) {
```

which calls \_autoClaimEarnings:

```Solidity
modifier autoClaimEarnings(address _delegator) {
        _autoClaimEarnings(_delegator);
        _;
```

which calls updateDelegatorWithEarnings:

```Solidity
function _autoClaimEarnings(address _delegator) internal {
        uint256 currentRound = roundsManager().currentRound();
        uint256 lastClaimRound = delegators[_delegator].lastClaimRound;
        if (lastClaimRound < currentRound) {
            updateDelegatorWithEarnings(_delegator, currentRound, lastClaimRound);
        }
    }
```

During updateDelegatorWithEarnings, both delegator.lastClaimRound and delegator.bondedAmount can be assigned new values.

```Solidity
        del.lastClaimRound = _endRound;
        // Rewards are bonded by default
        del.bondedAmount = currentBondedAmount;
```

However, during the lifecycle of all these functions, \_checkpointBondingState is never called either directly or through the autoCheckpoint modifier resulting in lastClaimRound & bondedAmount's values being stale in BondingVotes.sol.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add autoCheckpoint modifier to the withdrawFees function.

# Low Risk and Non-Critical Issues

For this audit, 7 reports were submitted by wardens detailing low risk and non-critical issues. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/150) by **Proxy** received the top score from the judge.

*The following wardens also submitted reports: [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/86), [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/249), [favelanky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/214), [nadin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/209), [Banditx0x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/205), and [DavidGiladi](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/158).*

## [01] There is no way to decrease the max number of active transcoders

[`setNumActiveTranscoders()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L182-L190) sets the maximum number of active transcoders however there is no way to decrease the number since [`setMaxSize()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/libraries/SortedDoublyLL.sol#L36-L44) does not allow it.

```javascript
function setNumActiveTranscoders(uint256 _numActiveTranscoders) external onlyControllerOwner {
    transcoderPool.setMaxSize(_numActiveTranscoders);

    emit ParameterUpdate("numActiveTranscoders");
}
```

```javascript
function setMaxSize(Data storage self, uint256 _size) public {
    require(_size > self.maxSize, "new max size must be greater than old max size");

    self.maxSize = _size;
}
```

## [02] When removing transcoders `Transcoder.activationRound` should be set to 0 for inactive

Function [`tryToJoinActiveSet()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L1416-L1418) removes a transcoder if `transcoderPool.isFull()` however it does not set `Transcoder.activationRound` of the transcoder to 0 for inactive.
In [`Transcoder`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L44) struct it says if a transcoder is inactive `activationRound` should be 0.

```javascript
uint256 activationRound; // Round in which the transcoder became active - 0 if inactive
```

```javascript
transcoderPool.remove(lastTranscoder);
transcoders[lastTranscoder].deactivationRound = _activationRound; // @audit Transcoder.activationRound should be 0 - for inactive
pendingNextRoundTotalActiveStake = pendingNextRoundTotalActiveStake.sub(lastStake);
```

## [03] No function implemented for `setMaxEarningsClaimsRounds()`

The [constructor](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L140-L148) natspec says that `setMaxEarningsClaimsRounds()` should be called to initialize state variables post-deployment. However there is no such function implemented anywhere.

```javascript
/**
 * @notice BondingManager constructor. Only invokes constructor of base Manager contract with provided Controller address
 * @dev This constructor will not initialize any state variables besides `controller`. The following setter functions
 * should be used to initialize state variables post-deployment:
 * - setUnbondingPeriod()
 * - setNumActiveTranscoders()
 * - setMaxEarningsClaimsRounds()
 * @param _controller Address of Controller that this contract will be registered with
 */
```

## [04] Typos

- GovernorCountingOverriable.sol ( [#L35](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/treasury/GovernorCountingOverridable.sol#L35) , [#L59](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/treasury/GovernorCountingOverridable.sol#L59) ):

```javascript
    // @audit Typo - instead of "specicic" use "specific"
35: // @dev Tracks state of specicic voters in a single proposal.

    // @audit Typo - instead of "abstain" use "against"
59: // @notice The required percentage of "for" votes in relation to the total opinionated votes (for and abstain) for
```

- BondingVotes.sol ([#L65-66](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingVotes.sol#L65-L66)):

```javascript
    // @audit Typo - instead of "Notce that..." use "Notice that this is different"
65: // @dev Stores a list of checkpoints for the total active stake, queryable and mapped by round. Notce that
66: // differently from bonding checkpoints, it's only accessible on the specific round. To access the checkpoint for a
```

## [05] Functions need a more descriptive name

Some functions say they set one thing but set something different and some function names are too ambiguous.

- [`setTreasuryRewardCutRate()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L167) and [_setTreasuryRewardCutRate()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L1176) set `nextRoundTreasuryRewardCutRate` not `treasuryRewardCutRate`

- [`transcoder()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L198) and [`transcoderWithHint()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L485) are too ambiguous

# Gas Optimizations

For this audit, 13 reports were submitted by wardens detailing gas optimizations. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer-findings/issues/222) by **c3phas** received the top score from the judge.

## Notes from the Auditor

### Auditor's Disclaimer 

While we try our best to maintain readability in the provided code snippets, some functions have been truncated to highlight the affected portions.

It's important to note that during the implementation of these suggested changes, developers must exercise caution to avoid introducing vulnerabilities. Although the optimizations have been tested prior to these recommendations, it is the responsibility of the developers to conduct thorough testing again.

Code reviews and additional testing are strongly advised to minimize any potential risks associated with the refactoring process.

### Note on Gas Estimates

We've tried to give the exact amount of gas being saved from running the included tests, whenever the function is within the test coverage.

**All suggested changes have been  tested per function to ensure we don't encounter stack too deep error.**<br>
Most of the changes involve rewriting functions and as such changes are suggested on a function basis.<br>
We would love to look at this code again if they end up implementing the changes on this report.

*When doing the refactoring, we've avoided including any changes that were reported by the bot and we encourage you to go through the automated findings to maximum the amount of gas being saved.*

## [G-01] Function `processRebond()` can be more optimized (Save 207 Gas on average)

Gas benchmarks based on function `rebondWithHint()` which calls our function of interest.

```solidity
File: /contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol
1564:    function processRebond(
1565:        address _delegator,
1566:        uint256 _unbondingLockId,
1567:        address _newPosPrev,
1568:        address _newPosNext
1569:    ) internal autoCheckpoint(_delegator) {
1570:        Delegator storage del = delegators[_delegator];
1571:        UnbondingLock storage lock = del.unbondingLocks[_unbondingLockId];

1573:        require(isValidUnbondingLock(_delegator, _unbondingLockId), "invalid unbonding lock ID");
```

Of interest to us is the require statement on line 1573:<br>
`require(isValidUnbondingLock(_delegator, _unbondingLockId), "invalid unbonding lock ID");`

The statement makes a function call to `isValidUnbondingLock()` which we can see its implementation on https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L1167-L1170.

```solidity
File: /contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol
1167:    function isValidUnbondingLock(address _delegator, uint256 _unbondingLockId) public view returns (bool) {
1168:       // A unbonding lock is only valid if it has a non-zero withdraw round (the default value is zero)
1169:        return delegators[_delegator].unbondingLocks[_unbondingLockId].withdrawRound > 0;
1170:    }
```
Note the return statement in the above function `return delegators[_delegator].unbondingLocks[_unbondingLockId].withdrawRound > 0;`.<br>
We make some state reads by reading `delegators[_delegator]`.

Back to our original function context, note we also made the same state read on https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L1570.

```solidity
1570:        Delegator storage del = delegators[_delegator];
```

The require statement ends up doing the following:<br>
`require(delegators[_delegator].unbondingLocks[_unbondingLockId].withdrawRound > 0,"invalid unbonding lock ID");`

Note the variable `delegators[_delegator].unbondingLocks[_unbondingLockId]` is equivalent to the variable `lock` declared here  `UnbondingLock storage lock = del.unbondingLocks[_unbondingLockId];`

If we inline the function `isValidUnbondingLock()` we can avoid making this two state reads and take advantage of the already declared variable.

257:        );
```

**Similar to the previous explanations with some additional refactoring**<br>
After the refactoring explained in the previous case, the variable `lock.withdrawRound` was found to be called 3 times, with the 3rd call being a memory store ie `uint256 withdrawRound = lock.withdrawRound;`. We can optimize the code further by making this memory store call before we make our validations using the require statements and use the memory variable in the require statement instead of reading the `lock.withdrawRound`. In the worst case(sad path) where we fail on the 1st require check, we would only waste ~6 gas for `mstore/mload`. The benefit outweighs the cons thus we should refactor.

The require statement  on line 499 makes a call to the function `isActiveTranscoder(msg.sender)` which has the following implementation 
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L1145-L1149.

```solidity
File: /contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol
1145:    function isActiveTranscoder(address _transcoder) public view returns (bool) {
1146:        Transcoder storage t = transcoders[_transcoder];
1147:        uint256 currentRound = roundsManager().currentRound();
1148:        return t.activationRound <= currentRound && currentRound < t.deactivationRound;
1149:    }
```

Note the first two lines of this implementation:
```solidity
1146:        Transcoder storage t = transcoders[_transcoder];
1147:        uint256 currentRound = roundsManager().currentRound();
```
If we look at the calling function, `transcoderWithHint()` we are making the same calls.

```solidity
496:        Transcoder storage t = transcoders[msg.sender];
497:        uint256 currentRound = roundsManager().currentRound();
```
**Additional optimizations**<br>
On line 494, we have a check `require(isRegisteredTranscoder(msg.sender), "transcoder must be registered");` that makes a function call to `isRegisteredTranscoder` which has the following implementation:

```solidity
1156:    function isRegisteredTranscoder(address _transcoder) public view returns (bool) {
1157:        Delegator storage d = delegators[_transcoder];
1158:        return d.delegateAddress == _transcoder && d.bondedAmount > 0;
1159:    }
```

In our context we pass `msg.sender` as the value for `_transcoder`. If we could inline this function, we can avoid making another state read to `delegators[msg.sender]` on the line [510](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L510) in the main function. we read it here `delegators[msg.sender].delegatedAmount,`.<br>
Since we already cache it as `d`, referencing `d` would save us some gas.

854:        );

856:        Transcoder storage t = transcoders[msg.sender];
```

We look into the implementation of the function `isActiveTranscoder` which is being called in the require statement. The function has the following implementation:

```solidity
1145:    function isActiveTranscoder(address _transcoder) public view returns (bool) {
1146:        Transcoder storage t = transcoders[_transcoder];
1147:        uint256 currentRound = roundsManager().currentRound();
1148:        return t.activationRound <= currentRound && currentRound < t.deactivationRound;
1149:    }
```

Put the above implementation in the context of our main function and we see two similar lines in both functions.

```solidity
1146:        Transcoder storage t = transcoders[_transcoder];
1147:        uint256 currentRound = roundsManager().currentRound();
```

This means we are making this calls twice, one in the function being called, and the other one by the calling function.<br>
To avoid this, we can inline the function `isActiveTranscoder()` and refactor the code as follows:

## [G-05] Function `increaseTotalStakeUncheckpointed()` can be more optimized (save 148 Gas on average)

1320:            uint256 nextRound = currRound.add(1);

1343:        // Increase delegate's delegated amount
1344:        delegators[_delegate].delegatedAmount = newStake;
1345:    }
```

The if statement makes a call to a function `isRegisteredTranscoder(_delegate)` whose implementation is as follows:

```solidity
1156:    function isRegisteredTranscoder(address _transcoder) public view returns (bool) {
1157:        Delegator storage d = delegators[_transcoder];
1158:        return d.delegateAddress == _transcoder && d.bondedAmount > 0;
1159:    }
```

Note in the function above, we cache `delegators[_transcoder]` with `_transcoder` being the address passed to the function, so in the context of our function it would look like `Delegator storage d = delegators[_delegate];`
On the calling function line 1344, we write to the state variable `delegators[_delegate].delegatedAmount`, as we already cached the variable `delegators[_delegate]` we don't need to call it directly but instead we should use the cached reference. As the cached one is simply a pointer to the original one, we would still be writing to the state variable as required.

752:        Delegator storage del = delegators[msg.sender];
```

The require statement calls the function `delegatorStatus(msg.sender)` which has the implementation:

```solidity
956:    function delegatorStatus(address _delegator) public view returns (DelegatorStatus) {
957:        Delegator storage del = delegators[_delegator];

959:        if (del.bondedAmount == 0) {
960:            // Delegator unbonded all its tokens
961:            return DelegatorStatus.Unbonded;
962:        } else if (del.startRound > roundsManager().currentRound()) {
963:            // Delegator round start is in the future
964:            return DelegatorStatus.Pending;
965:        } else {

969:            return DelegatorStatus.Bonded;
970:        }
971:    }
```

Note we make a state read `Delegator storage del = delegators[_delegator];`.

In the calling function , we pass `msg.sender` as the function parameter which means our state read in the function being called is `Delegator storage del = delegators[msg.sender];` which is the same state read we make in the main function. This means we are making this call twice(too much gas).

For this to work, we introduce a new state variable to keep track of the status as shown below.

## [G-08] BondingVotes.sol: We can optimize the function `checkpointBondingState`

**Note: no gas estimates as it was not covered by the tests.**

```solidity
File: /contracts/bonding/BondingVotes.sol
258:    function checkpointBondingState(

266:    ) external virtual onlyBondingManager {

273:        BondingCheckpoint memory previous;
274:        if (hasCheckpoint(_account)) {
275:            previous = getBondingCheckpointAt(_account, _startRound);
276:        }

278:        BondingCheckpointsByRound storage checkpoints = bondingCheckpoints[_account];
```

The if statement on line 274 makes two function calls `hasCheckpoint(_account)` and `getBondingCheckpointAt(_account, _startRound)`.

The implementation of `hasCheckpoint(_account)`  is as below:

```solidity
315:    function hasCheckpoint(address _account) public view returns (bool) {
316:        return bondingCheckpoints[_account].startRounds.length > 0;
317:    }
```

We can see the return statement reads `bondingCheckpoints[_account]` which we already had cached in the main function as `checkpoints`. Inline the `hasCheckpoint` function would help us use the cached value.

The next function `getBondingCheckpointAt()` has an implementation that has the following state read:<br>
`BondingCheckpointsByRound storage checkpoints = bondingCheckpoints[_account];`<br>
Which is equivalent to the variable we cached in the main function. Inlining this  function would avoid making two state reads which are quite expensive.

We should refactor the code as follows:

## [G-09] Optimizing check order for cost efficient function execution

Checks that involve constants should come before checks that involve state variables, function calls, and calculations. By doing these checks first, the function is able to revert before wasting a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) in a function that may ultimately revert in the unhappy case.

## [G-10] Change the model of how events are emitted

Currently if we look at the event declaration we see something like this `event ParameterUpdate(string param);` and the actual emit as `emit ParameterUpdate("unbondingPeriod");`.<br>
This method seems quite interesting especially for readability as we can clearly tell what the event is about. However, this method is quite expensive and an anti pattern. We can actually achieve the same readability by using named parameters for our event argument and naming the events using a descriptive name.

### Description overview of Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade

The `Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade` is a significant enhancement to the `Livepeer protocol`, which is a decentralized video infrastructure platform used in `web3's` social media and media applications. The primary objective of this upgrade is to create an `onchain community treasury`. This treasury is funded through a percentage of protocol rewards generated by the network.

To achieve this, `OpenZeppelin governance` tools are leveraged, and a custom voting power module is implemented to facilitate onchain voting. The upgrade process is detailed in various technical documents such as [LIP-91](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-91.md), [LIP-89](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-89.md), and [LIP-92](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-92.md), which provide a comprehensive blueprint for the upgrade's implementation.

A critical aspect of this upgrade is ensuring that there are no significant changes to the behavior of the `core protocol contract`, known as the `BondingManager`, except for the specific modifications required to accommodate the community treasury. Attention is also paid to maintaining the security and integrity of the protocol to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities.

Additionally, it's worth noting that Livepeer employs a unique `staking rewards` calculation system, which is used not only for distributing rewards to participants but also for funding the community treasury.

### 1- System Overview

**Scope**

- [BondingManager.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol): An existing contract that oversees the management of protocol bonds, often referred to as staking, as well as rewards. This upgrade introduces the capability to facilitate state checkpointing and the creation of treasury rewards. This contract holds paramount significance within the audit due to its pivotal role in the current protocol.

- [BondingVotes.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/BondingVotes.sol): This contract stores checkpoints of the BondingManager state to facilitate an IERC5805Upgradeable (IVotes) implementation for the OpenZeppelin Governor.

- [EarningsPoolLIP36.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/libraries/EarningsPoolLIP36.sol): This library offers utility functions to calculate staking rewards utilizing the LIP-36 cumulative earnings algorithm.

- [SortedArrays.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/bonding/libraries/SortedArrays.sol): This library offers assistance for managing and searching within sorted arrays. It extends the functionality of Arrays.findUpperBound to include an equivalent findLowerBound for checkpoint retrieval.

- [GovernorCountingOverridable.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/treasury/GovernorCountingOverridable.sol): Abstract contract that implements an OpenZeppelin Governor counting module, enabling delegators to override their delegates' (transcoders) votes on a proposal.

- [Treasury.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/treasury/Treasury.sol): This contract inherits from TimelockControllerUpgradeable to enable initialization. It is used by the governor to hold funds and execute proposals.

- [LivepeerGovernor.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/main/contracts/treasury/LivepeerGovernor.sol): This contract serves as the practical Governor implementation, bringing together both the OZ built-in and custom modules and extensions into a tangible contract that can be instantiated and utilized. It primarily handles the framework necessary to assemble these components.

**Privileged Roles**

Some privileged roles exercise powers over the Controller contract:

- **TicketBroker**

```shell
    // Check if sender is TicketBroker
    modifier onlyTicketBroker() {
        _onlyTicketBroker();
        _;
    }
```

- **RoundManager**

```shell
    // Check if sender is RoundsManager
    modifier onlyRoundsManager() {
        _onlyRoundsManager();
        _;
    }
```

- **Verifier**

```shell
    // Check if sender is Verifier
    modifier onlyVerifier() {
        _onlyVerifier();
        _;
    }
```

We asked the sponsors about who will be responsible for these roles, and this was their response:

```shell
victorges â€” 09/2/2023 at 12:20
Hey warden!
The roles are managed by a special controller owner address which handles protocol governance. See the controller contact that holds all the contract (roles) addresses
```

```shell
dob | Livepeer â€” 09/2/2023 at 3:29
I have seen a few questions come through about the Verifier role, and whether it is trusted.

Only the registered "Verifier" in the Controller contract can call the slashTranscoder function. The registered verifier contract is 0x0000000000.... the null address. Hence it can't be invoked right now, as slashing is not active in the protocol.
```

`Given the level of control that these roles possess within the system, users must place full trust in the fact that the entities overseeing these roles will always act correctly and in the best interest of the system and its users.`

### 2- Codebase analysis through diagrams.

The main most important contracts of `Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade`.

- In this audit, the protocol provided `5 contracts` and `2 libraries`. Here's a detailed diagrams of the essential components of each ones:

**Contracts:**

**1. BondingManager:**

![BondingManager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98446738/275616922-9865ac93-6a8d-4fc9-9136-1fcdd94d0063.png)

We have created a diagram organized into sections to facilitate understanding for both `developers` and `auditors` of the main contract. This contract is responsible for managing three fundamental areas: `Delegator and Transcoder Management`, `Asset and Stake Management`, and `Reward Management and State Update`.

The contract plays a critical role in managing protocol `bonds` and `rewards`. A significant upgrade adds support for creating state checkpointing and generating rewards for the protocol's treasury. Additionally, the code includes sections related to the management of a decentralized video transcoding system, where delegates actively participate, and transcoders compete for rewards.

**2. BondingVotes:**

![BondingVotes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98446738/275617082-39a44ce2-a092-43d2-bce7-f6d285756b82.png)

In this `BondingVotes` diagram, we provide a concise description of each function implemented by the contract. `BondingVotes` is responsible for the `checkpointing` logic for the state of the `BondingManager` and its primary purpose is to perform `historical calculations` related to participation in the `Livepeer` network.

**3. GovernorCountingOverridable:**

![GovernorCountingOverridable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98446738/275617214-09769597-c1d1-4b50-a142-e89160ebb7eb.png)

In this `diagram`, we review the `functions` performed in the contract and their respective purposes. The `GovernorCountingOverridable` contract serves as a foundation for implementing `decentralized governance systems` that allow `delegates` to override the votes of the `transcoders` they have delegated to. It also provides logic for `vote counting` and determining the `success of proposals`.

**4. Treasury:**

![Treasury](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98446738/275617360-f2045d79-7d75-473a-ab38-d0026bb0a994.png)

The `Treasury` contract is used to `manage treasury funds` and `governance proposals` in `Livepeer`, and its `initialization` function is `responsible` for `configuring` the `time-lock controller` for `governance`. The two main purposes of this contract are summarized in the provided `diagram`.

**5. LivepeerGovernor:**

![LivepeerGovernor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98446738/275617505-d769c6da-dca3-48cb-b117-e6e6dfa1ae47.png)

In this `diagram`, we illustrate how the `LivepeerGovernor` contract acts as the `treasury governor` in `Livepeer`. It utilizes `extensions` and other `contracts` to implement `governance logic` and `vote management`.

**Libraries**

**1. EarningsPoolLIP36:**

![EarningsPoolLIP36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98446738/275617697-017b4e98-d9e6-4bf1-9cc7-21eff6ebe9ba.png)

This `library` provides functions to update and calculate cumulative `fee` and `reward` factors in an `EarningsPool` and to `calculate` the cumulative `stake` and `fees` of a `delegator` based on these factors. The `diagram` includes all the `functions` in the library.

**2. SortedArrays:**

![SortedArrays](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98446738/275617861-d3d39b5f-f6a3-4095-a822-ea0986bbbad0.png)

This `library` is useful for working with `arrays` of integers sorted in ascending order. In the `diagram`, we specify both the `findLowerBound` function, which is particularly useful for searching for a value in the array and finding the `index` of the last element that is less than or equal to the searched value, and the `pushSorted` function, which allows you to add values to the array while maintaining order and avoiding duplicates.

### 3- Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade Architecture

This `diagram` illustrates the interaction among the key components of the `Livepeer protocol`. The `LivepeerGovernor` serves as the main governance system. The `BondingManager` is responsible for managing user participation, while `BondingVotes` is used to handle the voting logic. Lastly, the `Treasury` manages treasury funds and governance proposals related to the treasury. It also shows how a `user` engages with the system, all succinctly summarized in the diagram.

![Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98446738/275618065-4e310d78-2436-458d-a193-1f4cd38a4bb2.png)

- **Some potential areas of improvement or consideration could include**:

  - **User Experience**: Enhancing the user experience for both transcoders and token holders can attract more participants. User-friendly interfaces, improved documentation, and educational resources can be beneficial.

  - **Governance Flexibility**: Evaluating the governance mechanisms to ensure they are adaptable and can accommodate changes as the ecosystem evolves.

  - **Interoperability**: Exploring interoperability with other blockchain networks or protocols can expand Livepeer's capabilities and reach.

  - **Documentation and Education**: Comprehensive documentation and educational materials can help users understand and navigate the Livepeer ecosystem more effectively.

### 4- Documents

- The documentation of the `Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade` project is quite comprehensive and detailed, providing a solid overview of how `Livepeer` is structured and how its various aspects function. However, we have noticed that there is room for additional details, such as `diagrams`, to gain a deeper understanding of how different contracts interact and the functions they implement. With considerable enthusiasm, we have dedicated several days to creating diagrams for each of the contracts.
  We are confident that these diagrams will bring significant value to the protocol as they can be seamlessly integrated into the existing `documentation`, enriching it and providing a more comprehensive and detailed understanding for `users`, `developers` and `auditors`.

### 5- Systemic & Centralization Risks

Here's an analysis of potential systemic and centralization risks in the provided contracts:

**Systemic Risks:**

- **Smart Contract Vulnerability Risk**: Smart contracts can contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. If a smart contract has critical security flaws, such as `access errors` or `logic problems`, this could lead to `asset loss` or `system manipulation`. We strongly recommend that, once the protocol is audited, necessary actions be taken to `mitigate` any issues identified by `C4 Wardens`.

- **Third-Party Dependency Risk**: Contracts rely on external data sources, such as [@openzeppelin/contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/v4.9.2), and there is a risk that if any `issues` are found with these `dependencies` in your contracts, the `Livepeer` protocol could also be `affected`.

  - We observed that `old versions` of `OpenZeppelin` are used in the project, and these should be updated to the `latest version`:

  ```solidity
    54: "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.9.2",
    55: "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable": "^4.9.2",
  ```

  The latest `version` is `4.9.3` (as of July 28, 2023), while the project uses version `4.9.2`.

- **Update Risk**: If the smart contract needs to be updated, there is a risk that updates may be implemented incorrectly or that new versions introduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, updates can lead to divisions within the user community.

  - The protocol uses a `proxy`, and according to the `sponsor`, the type of `proxy` is:

  it's a custom proxy implemented/documented here
  https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-livepeer/blob/a3d801fa4690119b6f96aeb5508e58d752bda5bc/contracts/ManagerProxy.sol#L19
  it's more similar to a "transparent proxy" pattern than UUPS, with the target contract address being managed by the controller as well
  ```

  If the logic controlling the `proxy` is not implemented correctly, there could be `vulnerabilities` that allow an attacker to modify the underlying contract or the `proxy` itself in an unintended way.

**Centralization Risks:**

- **Participation Centralization**: If a small group of `transcoders` or `delegators` controls a significant portion of `assets` or `participation` in the `system`, this could lead to significant `centralization`. This could undermine `decentralization` and `system security`.

- **Decision-Making Centralization**: If a small group of actors has disproportionate control over key decisions, such as `system rule changes` or `reward allocation`, this could lead to a `centralized system` where decisions are made for the benefit of a few rather than the entire `community`.

- **Transcoder Node Centralization**: If a small number of `transcoders` dominate the active set, this could lead to `centralization` in the provision of `transcoding services`, resulting in `higher fees` or the `exclusion` of smaller actors.

### 6- New insights and learning from this audit

Our latest insights from the `Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade` protocol audit have been extensive. This audit has deepened our understanding of the `Livepeer` protocol `upgrade`, which introduces a community `treasury` funded by protocol `rewards`. The `upgrade` leverages `OpenZeppelin` governance primitives, underscoring the crucial role of auditing in upholding protocol integrity. It places particular emphasis on critical aspects like `reward` calculations and `highlights` security concerns, emphasizing the necessity of safeguarding against potential attacks to ensure ongoing system reliability. This audit has also showcased the protocol's adaptability, as it can seamlessly adjust its `reward` system and incorporate a `community treasury`.

### Conclusion

Overall, the `Livepeer Onchain Treasury Upgrade` presents an interesting `architecture` aimed at establishing `decentralized` infrastructure for `video streaming` in `web3` social and media applications. The development team has done a good job with the code. However, as is common in `blockchain` projects, `Livepeer` faces risks related to the security of its `smart contracts` and the `centralization` of key actors such as `transcoders` and `delegators`. Ultimately, the continued success of `Livepeer` will depend on its ability to address these challenges, especially after potential security issues are disclosed by `C4 wardens`. This will involve maintaining `security` and `decentralization` and remaining an attractive choice for `web3 video streaming` applications.
